# Computational Microbial Genomics project
Project for the Computational Microbial Genomics course, led by Professor Segata, academic year 2023/2024.

This report seeks to obtain comprehensive information about a dental plaque SGB, using a set of 30 genomes (MAGs). Our primary objective is to determine if peri-implantitis can be characterized based on the bacterial composition in different plaque samples. Additionally, we will compare our findings with patient metadata to identify external factors, such as smoking, obesity, and sex, that might impact the progression of the disease. The study involves a detailed analysis of the bacterial genomes and their assembly.
